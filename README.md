# DeepLearning-Music-Recognition-Project
This is a deep learning project concept. You’ll build a deep learning model that employs neural networks to automatically classify music genres. The model takes as an input the spectogram of music frames and analyzes the image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) plus a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The system’s output is a vector of the song’s projected genres. The model has been refined with a tiny sample (30 songs per genre) before testing it on the GTZAN dataset, resulting in an accuracy of 80%.
